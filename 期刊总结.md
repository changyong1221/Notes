## Cover Letter

### Cover Letter写法

**1. 什么是Cover letter?**

Cover Letter, 即投稿信，是论文投递时与论文一起发送给编辑的信件，其目的是让编辑在阅读你的论文之前，简单了解你文章的基本情况。Cover letter是编辑对论文的第一印象，也是初步评判你论文是否可以被期刊接收的重要依据（如果编辑看完Cover letter之后一点兴趣也没有，就没有下文了），因此Cover letter的撰写是非常重要的。如何用简明扼要的语言抓住编辑的心是Cover letter撰写时最关键的一点！

 

**2. Cover letter应该包含哪些内容？**

完整的Cover letter一般包含以下内容：

**A. 期刊编辑的姓名**（不知道编辑是谁的情况下直接用Dear editor）;

**B. 投稿文章的标题**

**C. 投稿文章的类型**（Letter, communications, article, review还是comments）

**D. 文章简介，**包括：(1)研究背景；(2)论文的重要发现；(3)论文可以发表在期刊上的原因：引发读者兴趣的地方，与期刊的契合之处等等

**E. 稿件出版道德规范的免责说明**（这个部分很多期刊在网站上投稿时会进行确认，cover letter里面可以不出现）**以及对稿件有无特殊处理要求**（一般指屏蔽某些竞争者成为审稿人）

**F. 作者信息：**一般为通讯作者姓名，所属机构，通讯地址，联系电话，邮箱等

**G. 推荐审稿人名单**（注：目前很多杂志社已经将这一部分挪到了投稿网站系统上，Cover letter中可以不再列出）

<img src="pictures/aHR0cHM6Ly9waWMxLnpoaW1nLmNvbS84MC92Mi1mOGM2YjY4NjU2NzI0YmMxNGNlMzQwYjE1NGY5NGVmMF9oZC5qcGc.jpeg" alt="img" style="zoom:150%;" />

 

**3. Cover Letter的具体写法示例：**

**A. 论文通讯作者的信息**，可以放到前面也可以放到后面，这个主要看个人习惯：

i) 放到最前面时，一般采用如下格式：

![img](pictures/aHR0cHM6Ly9waWMzLnpoaW1nLmNvbS84MC92Mi0wNmU4ZDJlYWQ0ODI5N2NiYjk2MDAzNDk3MjcxYzVkMl9oZC5qcGc.jpeg)

底下紧接Dear Editor...

 

ii) 放到后面的话，紧接作者署名的后面，可以简单地用下面的格式：

![img](pictures/aHR0cHM6Ly9waWMyLnpoaW1nLmNvbS84MC92Mi0zNThmZDRhNTJiNTE2YzM0ODZkMGM2NzU0OGFmMWYzMV9oZC5qcGc.jpeg)

 

**B. Cover letter第一段**

Dear editor（如果确切知道编辑名称，可以直接写其名字，一般是editor-in-chief主编）,

We are submitting a manuscript entitled “论文标题” for your consideration for publication as a communication in 期刊名.

 

Cover Letter的第一段就是要简明扼要地告诉编辑：你要干什么？

 

类似的，还有：

Dear editor,

Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled “论文标题” which we would like to submit for publication as a communication in 期刊名.

 

标准的，一般还需要在第一段进行投稿的道德规范免责说明：

The work described has not been submitted elsewhere for publication, in whole or in part, and all the authors listed have approved the manuscript that is enclosed.

 

**C. \**Cover letter第二段\****

第二段开始是整个cover letter的核心部分，要告诉editor这篇文章的亮点在哪里，有何创新之处，为什么适合于发表在这个期刊上，有哪些点可以吸引到期刊的读者等等。

备注：这个部分确实很重要，但是很难给大家列出一个很恰当的实例，容我三思，准备一下，下次再推出

 

**D. Cover letter最后**

\1) 屏蔽竞争对手成为审稿人

例句：Due to a direct competition and conflict of interest, we request that Drs. XXX of Harvard Univ., and YY of Yale Univ. not be considered as reviewers.

 

2）推荐审稿人：一般找论文参考文献的作者，也可以推荐你在学术会议上认识的相关领域的朋友等。

The following is a list of possible reviewers for your consideration:
\1) Name A E-mail: ××××@××××
\2) Name B E-mail: ××××@××××

 

3）按照信件的格式进行署名,一般如：

Sincerely yours, Best wishes, Best regards, XXX. 在署名前也可以加上一些客套话（不是必须的），如：

We deeply appreciate your consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving comments from the reviewers. If you have any queries, please don’t hesitate to contact me at the address below.

4）写完后，信件最最后给出**通讯作者**的名字，地址和联系方式（邮箱）等。

### 投稿信（自己版本）

Dear editor：
We would like to submit the enclosed manuscript entitled “DDDQN-TS: A Task Scheduling and Load Balancing Method based on Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning in Heterogeneous Computing Environment”, which we wish to be considered for publication as a research paper in International Journal of Intelligent Systems. No conflict of interest exists in the submission of this manuscript, and the manuscript is approved by all authors for publication. I would like to declare on behalf of my co-authors that the work described is original research that has not been published previously, and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, in whole or in part. All the authors listed have approved the manuscript that is enclosed.

In this work, we make the following major contributions: 1) We formulate task scheduling problem as a Markov decision process so that we can apply reinforcement learning method on it. 2) We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning based task scheduler named DDDQN-TS to address the task scheduling problem of heterogeneous computing environment, which improves the original deep Q-network (DQN) with double Q-learning algorithm, dueling network architectures, target networks and experience replay techniques. 3) We meticulously design the reward function to realize multi-objective optimization by taking task execution time and average std of CPU utilization of machines into consideration. 4) We evaluate our proposed method on two publicly published data set GoCJ and Alibaba cluster trace dataset to simulate real-world workload scenarios, and compared the performance of proposed method with several baselines, showing that it clearly outperforms other algorithms.  

Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have led to the development of intelligent systems in a variety of fields, and we adopt this state-of-the-art techque on task scheduling problems to make the task scheduling process more intelligent and more efficient. I hope this paper is suitable for International Journal of Intelligent Systems.

We deeply appreciate your consideration of our manuscript, and we look forward to receiving comments from the reviewers. If you have any queries, please don’t hesitate to contact me at the address below.
Thank you and best regards.
Yours sincerely,
Tan Yang

### 第二次催稿信（自己版本）

Dear editor:
Sorry for disturbing you once again. I am not sure if it is the right time to contact you to inquire about the status of my submitted manuscript titled “DDDQN-TS: A Task Scheduling and Load Balancing Method based on Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning in Heterogeneous Computing Environment”(Manuscript Number:INT2.20211715), but the status of “Under consideration” has been lasting for nearly four months, since submitted to journal on 28th October. In fact, I sent you one e-mail to confirm the status of our manuscript two months ago and we were told that we would be notified regarding the decision shortly. But two months later the status of our manuscript remains "Under consideration". Eager to know the decision of our manuscript, we send you one e-mail again to inquire about the status of our manuscript.

### 询问情况

Dear editor:
Sorry for disturbing you. I am the first author of submitted manuscript titled “DRL-TA: A Type-aware Task Scheduling and Load Balancing Method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Heterogeneous Computing Environment”(Submission 8956). Not long ago I was informed that the paper was accepted, but there are still some revisions to be done. Now I have finished the camera-ready version of my article but I can't find the entry to submit the updated paper on the system of EasyChair. So I would like to ask how to submit the final draft of the paper. Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards!
Yours sincerely,
Changyong Sun
